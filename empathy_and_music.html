        Music gives us an inner glimpse of those around us and fosters the development of empathic relationships with others. The research article titled, “Neurological Effects of   Trait Empathy in Music Listening” delves into two experiments conducted by Wallmark et. al (2018) from “Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience” concerning the psychological connection between musical experience and empathy. These studies demonstrated that musical sounds can generate neural responses consistent with theories of empathy.

          <h2>Experiment 1</h2>
<br>
Music can no longer be labeled only as a method of self-expression but also as a way for highly empathic people to process the social atmosphere. In Experiment 1, the central focus was determining how timbre affects the way people engage with musical tidbits in a non-musical context and how empathy plays a role in this process. The researchers postulated that trait empathy and “increased recruitment of empathy circuits” when “listening to brief isolated sounds out of musical context” have correlation (Wallmark et. al). In addition, they believed that those with higher empathy would favor “louder” noises because traditionally, they signify negative emotions such as stress. 
<br>
Fifteen UCLA undergraduates were recruited for the experimental study. The subjects were required to listen to brief isolated timbres while being scanned. The participants were then instructed to relax and keep their heads in a stationary position while keeping their eyes open.
<br>
Following the experiment, researchers first checked if their data was “normal,” meaning following a distinct pattern. The researchers then checked how the subjects felt about the different stimuli through three distinct categories: how much effort it took to listen to the sounds, how negative the sounds made them feel, and how noisy the sounds were. The overall consensus was that noisier sounds had a less positive response. There were some interesting results; most subjects found that a female voice was noisier and more negatively valenced than an electric guitar. 
<br>
Experiment 1 demonstrated that people with higher trait empathy have increased activation of circuitry in areas of the brain linked to sharing emotions like the sensorimotor areas and insula, when they hear different isolated timbres.

<h2>Experiment 2</h2> 
<br>
Experiment 2 focused on naturalistic stimuli, consisting of excerpts of music selected by the subjects themselves, to garner empathy's effect on the way humans process music. Twenty UCLA undergraduates with strong positive/negative emotions towards music were recruited to carry out this study.
<br>
The stimuli for Experiment 2 consisted of sixteen excerpts of prerecorded music, half of which were selected previously with each participant. The stimuli were categorized into four sections: familiar liked, familiar disliked, unfamiliar liked, and unfamiliar disliked. For familiar liked and disliked, subjects were asked to bring four songs they loved and four songs they hated. 
<br>
The other eight stimuli were hand-selected by a variety of researchers in collaboration with a musical scholar at UCLA. The unfamiliar stimuli matched the stylistic features of the familiar songs, took account of the subject’s music taste in orientation meetings, and were created to be unrecognizable to undergraduate music majors. In comparison to Experiment 1, participants were asked to listen to randomized stimuli while being scanned. 
<br>
Further analysis demonstrated that liking music activated the left ventral palladium and thalamus in the brain, aligning with previous research that showed these areas as part of the brain’s reward system. The reward system is “related to pleasure and other positive emotions” and impairments of the area can lead to “addictive behaviors”(“Science Daily”). In vivid contrast, disliking music activated different areas in the brain including the right anterior insula, medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and amygdala/parahippocampus. The right anterior insula is associated with emotional empathy and reacts to both positive and negative music. The amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex are associated with negative emotions and regulation. Unfamiliar music activated the superior frontal gyrus more than familiar music and familiar music activated a widespread network across the brain involved in various cognitive and emotional processes.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>  
In the two experiments performed by Wallmark et. al (2018) using fMRI scans, it was concluded that people with higher modes of empathy process music in a different manner than those that do not. People with higher modes of empathy show more activity in the brain involved with emotions and thinking while listening to music. These areas include the brain involved in feeling (sensorimotor regions, insular and cingulate cortex) and thinking (prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction). An interesting finding of these experiments was that when subjects were tasked with listening to timbres it activated areas in the brain with a relationship with movement and emotions. However when listening to complete pieces of music, empathic subjects’ response systems held a greater involvement of the reward system of the brain and areas responsible for processing social information. Empathic participants tended to be more sensitive to isolated, noisy timbres showing activation of SMA. In Experiment 2, the correlation between empathy and liking unfamiliar musical stimuli demonstrated that empathic people were more likely to be more receptive to new music, even excerpts they didn’t resonate with.  

Altogether, these experiments confirm the neuropsychological connection between music and empathy and introduce us to a wider world of music perception and social cognition.
