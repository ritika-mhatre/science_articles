CRISPR is a well-known biomedical tool utilized for gene editing and splicing. For years, scientists had tried to correct disease-causing mutations. Even though they were generally successful, there were a couple of tragedies. 
</p>
          <h2>Experiment 1</h2> 
<p>
  Children with X-linked immunodeficiency disorders participated in a trial that tested CRISPR technology. 17 out of 20 patients were successfully cured; however, five developed T-cell leukemia, with one child dying from chemotherapy-refractory leukemia. What happened?
</p>
<p>
In the cases of leukemia, the SCID X-1 gene had been inserted into the patient's genome near the tumor-promoting gene and caused those genes to be expressed. This is shown through the kids developing forms of leukemia due to this transcriptional error. This tragedy’s source lies in its delivery method. Therefore, it is crucial that gene therapy technologies allow for very specific editing to improve success rates and reduce the risk of mutations. 
</p>
<p>
There has been extended progress in gene therapy technologies over the years. One such advance includes the discovery of site-specific nucleases for gene editing called zinc finger nucleases. There has also been shocking new progress in advancing tools designed for the delivery of materials to targeted cells to assist with genetic editing. These tools include ex vivo and in vivo. Ex vivo gene editing is when the cells are taken out of the patient’s body, edited in a controlled lab setting, then put back into the patient. This is only done when the edits are confirmed by scientists to be safe and effective. 
</p>
<p>
This approach gives scientists more control over precision and reduces the risk of negative effects occurring. This is a truly revolutionary biotechnology technique that will change gene editing for years to come.
