When I was tutoring a girl last week, I had eight pairs of eyes on me as I modeled equations on the old dry-erase board. Seven of those pairs were glazed over, not due to any dullness on my part, but due to their plastic composition. At just 8 years old, this girl fully immerses herself in a world where her stuffed animals take on the roles of real people. Does she truly believe that they are alive and can talk to her? She might insist that they are real by simulating a walking motion with them or practicing ventriloquism and insisting that “only real people can perform such actions,” but deep down, even she knows the truth. So why does she insist her stuffed animals are her real-life classmates? To understand this, it is essential to understand her backstory. As a young girl with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and level two Autism, her parents decided it was a good idea to homeschool her to save her from the cruel judgment of the outside world and allow her to walk through life at her own comfortable pace. However, her lack of presence in a real classroom with real people caused her to manifest her own “classmates” in the form of her various stuffed animals. Her lack of familiarity with people her age causes her to communicate through inanimate objects, highlighting her inexperience with talking to other people and expressing herself. Her behavior surfaces a deeper truth: without exposure to social environments, kids like her miss out on developing important interpersonal skills. Neurodivergent kids need an educational environment filled with peers their own age to help prevent isolation and to provide them with opportunities to experience the wider world beyond their home.

          <h2>EXPERIMENT AND DISCUSSION</h2> 
<p>
  Individuals with autism and other neurological disorders find a lowered ability to interact with the human world and understand social situations. There has been an added effort over the years to increase the number of neurodivergent children integrated into mainstream classroom environments. It is argued that doing so helps build critical life skills needed for their great transition into society. 
The following experiment, conducted in Los Angeles, mapped out social networks and demonstrated how even one friendship can make a significant difference in neurodivergent children’s social experience. Children in an elementary school were grouped by grade (early, middle, late). Each child with autism disorder was matched with one typical peer to form a comparison group for the experiment. They considered each child’s social experiences using classroom surveys: friend nominations, reciprocal/mutual friendships, social network centrality, and peer acceptance/rejection. They compared the level of friendship children with autism had versus that of typical children through quantitative data and observations. The conclusion drawn from the experiment was that children with autism who had at least one reciprocal friendship were more central in their social networks (better connected) and more accepted by peers, even after accounting for gender, ethnicity, and IQ. This suggests friendships with other kids play an important role in improving social standing and relationships for kids with autism.
Therefore, the integration of autistic kids in classroom settings is important. These children need a supportive environment to form and keep friendships in order to prepare them for the real world.
